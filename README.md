A script to export my RSS articles into a JSON. Supports Newsblur and Feedbin but Feedbin is the main focus because that's what I mostly use nowadays. This was mainly a project for myself so I need to work on the convenience of the app.

# Roadmap

* Proper terminal interface
* Switching between unstarring and exporting.
* Supporting feed id arguments.
* Default config settings.
* Switching between Feedbin and Newsblur
